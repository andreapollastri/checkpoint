# Checkpoint

> A Laravel security scanner that audits your application for common vulnerabilities — from known CVEs to hardcoded secrets — via a single Artisan command.

```
php artisan checkpoint:scan
```

---

## Requirements

- **PHP** `^8.1` (see [Framework support](#framework-support) for how your Laravel version may raise the floor)
- **Laravel** `8`–`13` (same major as `illuminate/*` 8.x–13.x used by your app)

---

## Installation

```bash
composer require --dev andreapollastri/checkpoint
```

The package auto-discovers itself via Laravel's package discovery — no manual registration needed.

---

## Recommended companion tools

Checkpoint is a static scanner — it inspects your codebase but doesn't intercept package installs. To harden the npm install path against the next event-stream/ua-parser-js/chalk-style supply-chain attack, pair Checkpoint with a runtime guard:

### Safe-Chain (recommended)

[Safe-Chain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aikidosec/safe-chain) by Aikido is a free shell shim that blocks known-malicious npm packages **before** their install scripts run. Install it once, globally:

```bash
npm install -g @aikidosec/safe-chain
safe-chain setup
```

Checkpoint's **Supply Chain Tooling** check verifies whether Safe-Chain (or an equivalent like Socket CLI) is on your `PATH` and emits a `WARN` if no protection is present.

> Why Checkpoint doesn't install it for you: Safe-Chain works as a global shell shim, not a project dependency. A `composer require` should never invoke another ecosystem's package manager (and can't reliably do so on hosts without Node). Installing it explicitly keeps the install path auditable.

---

## Usage

### Run all checks

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:scan
```

### Run only specific checks

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:scan --only="SQL Injection Risks,CSRF Protection"
```

### Skip specific checks

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:scan --skip="NPM CVE Audit,Debug Functions in Production Code"
```

### JSON output (for CI/CD pipelines)

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:scan --json
```

The command exits with code `1` if any check returns `FAIL`, making it suitable as a pipeline gate.

---

## Configuration

Checkpoint works out of the box with sensible defaults. Publish the config file when you need to toggle individual checks or tune the freshness gate:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=checkpoint-config
```

This creates `config/checkpoint.php` with two sections:

### Enabling / disabling checks

Every default check is listed and enabled. Set any entry to `false` to exclude it from the scan:

```php
'checks' => [
    Checks\ComposerAuditCheck::class      => true,
    Checks\NpmAuditCheck::class           => false, // skip npm audit on a PHP-only project
    Checks\EnvironmentCheck::class        => true,
    // …
    Checks\PackageFreshnessCheck::class   => true,
    Checks\SupplyChainToolingCheck::class => true,
],
```

> Checks not listed in the map fall back to **enabled**. When you upgrade Checkpoint and new checks are added, you keep the protection without re-publishing the config — re-publish only when you want to see the full updated list.

### Package Freshness tuning

```php
'package_freshness' => [
    'minimum_age_days' => 3,
    'whitelist' => [
        'andreapollastri/checkpoint', // bundled — see note below
        // 'laravel/framework',
        // 'symfony/console',
    ],
],
```

- `minimum_age_days` — packages released more recently than this fail the scan. Default `3`.
- `whitelist` — fully-qualified package names (`vendor/package`) exempt from the freshness check. Use sparingly and ideally with an inline comment explaining why each entry is allowed.

> Checkpoint ships with `andreapollastri/checkpoint` already whitelisted by default — a fresh release of the scanner itself should never block its own user's deploy. Remove the entry if you want to gate even Checkpoint upgrades through the freshness window.

### Suppressing individual findings

Every `WARN` or `FAIL` finding is shown with a stable 12-character hash:

```
FAIL  Hardcoded Secrets
      3 potential hardcoded secret(s) found.
        ✗ app/Services/PaymentService.php:14 — 'api_key' => 'sk_live_…' [a1b2c3d4e5f6]
        ✗ config/services.php:8 — $secret = 'super…'                    [9f8e7d6c5b4a]
```

To silence one — false positive, accepted legacy code, internal test fixture — copy the bracketed hash into `config/checkpoint.php`:

```php
'suppressed' => [
    'a1b2c3d4e5f6',
    '9f8e7d6c5b4a',
],
```

On the next run those findings are filtered out. If every finding of a given check ends up suppressed, the check is downgraded to `PASS` with an explicit `"All N finding(s) suppressed via config."` message — so the suppression is visible in the output, not silently ignored.

The hash is content-stable: refactors that only shift line numbers within the same file will **not** invalidate the suppression. The hash *does* change if you alter the file path or the finding content itself, which is the intended safety net.

> The `--only` / `--skip` CLI flags still work and override the config for the current run, which is handy for ad-hoc scans without editing the config.

## Extending with custom checks

Create a class that extends `AbstractCheck` and return a `CheckResult`:

```php
use Checkpoint\Checks\AbstractCheck;
use Checkpoint\Checks\CheckResult;

class MyCustomCheck extends AbstractCheck
{
    public function name(): string
    {
        return 'My Custom Check';
    }

    public function run(): CheckResult
    {
        // your logic here
        return CheckResult::pass('Everything looks good.');
        // or: CheckResult::warn('Something to review.', ['detail one', 'detail two']);
        // or: CheckResult::fail('Critical issue found.', ['detail']);
    }
}
```

Then register it by building a `Scanner` manually instead of using the default:

```php
use Checkpoint\Scanner;

$scanner = Scanner::withDefaultChecks(base_path())
    ->add(new MyCustomCheck());
```

---

## CI/CD integration

Checkpoint can scaffold a ready-to-use pipeline for either provider in one command.

### GitHub Actions

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:github
```

Creates `.github/workflows/checkpoint.yml` — triggers on push to `main`/`master` and on every pull request. Uses `actions/checkout@v4`, `shivammathur/setup-php@v2` (PHP 8.2), Composer cache, and runs `php artisan checkpoint:scan`. Pass `--force` to overwrite an existing file.

### GitLab CI

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:gitlab
```

Creates `.gitlab-ci.yml` — runs on merge requests and default-branch pushes using the `composer:2` image with a Composer cache. If you already have a `.gitlab-ci.yml`, the command refuses to overwrite and prints the snippet to stdout so you can paste it into your existing pipeline. Use `--force` to overwrite.

### Custom usage

If you prefer to wire Checkpoint into a pipeline you already maintain, just call:

```yaml
- name: Security audit
  run: php artisan checkpoint:scan --json | tee checkpoint-report.json
```

### Composer hooks

Run Checkpoint automatically after every `composer install` / `composer update`:

```bash
php artisan checkpoint:install-hooks
```

This appends `@php artisan checkpoint:scan` to `scripts.post-update-cmd` and `scripts.post-install-cmd` in your `composer.json`. The command:

- Confirms interactively before touching `composer.json` (skip the prompt with `--no-interaction` for CI).
- Is idempotent: re-running on an already-installed setup is a no-op.
- Preserves any existing hooks (append-only); does **not** overwrite scripts owned by other tools.
- Supports `--remove` to cleanly uninstall and `--force` to replace stale Checkpoint entries.

> **Why only `post-*`, not `pre-*`?** Composer's `pre-update-cmd` fires *before* dependencies are resolved, so the scanner would only see the codebase pre-update — useless against a malicious package that's about to be installed. And on a fresh clone there is no `vendor/`, so `php artisan` does not exist yet and `pre-install-cmd` would crash. Real-time interception of malicious installs is the job of [Safe-Chain](#recommended-companion-tools).

### Exit codes

| Code | Meaning                              |
| ---- | ------------------------------------ |
| `0`  | All checks passed (or warnings only) |
| `1`  | At least one check returned `FAIL`   |
